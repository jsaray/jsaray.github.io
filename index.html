			<h3><span>Introduction and Motivation</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>Even with the raise of Internet and Social Media, conventional mass media still influences people over TV, press and Radio, and they are yet one of the hidden rulers of a nation. </span>
			<br>
			<br>
			<span>
			They can  influence people on different ways : they impose a reality over people, as they are the ones who choose which information must be broadcasted, and which information must be banned, they have also the power to choose words and sentences to their convenience to tell a story and provoke emotions on the spectator. Moreover, mass media are not kindness  and selfless actors looking always for the general interests, as they follow the interests of their stakeholders and owners, usually spreading hoaxes and rumors going against their initial mission of tell what is really happening. 
			</span>
			<br>
			<br>
			<span>
			By all these reasons, is important to provide knowledge about the owners of mass media in a country.

			<h3><span>Public Concerned</span></h3>

			<p class="p1"><span>The next data visualisation tools are targeted to french citizens that receive information through conventional mass-media and are curious about knowing which are the people/economic groups that are influencing more citizens through the mass media.</span></p>

			<h3><span>Technical Choices</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>
			We have used different techniques in order to produce the final results that you can see here. 
			First of all, we have centralized different excel DataSets in one Excel sheet extracting and filtering only the useful information. Then we used Java programming language to transform this excel sheet in a Json Object to be parsed by D3 javascript framework, we have choosen this JavaScript framework thanks to its versatility and esthetically appealing results.</span></p>
		</div>

		<div id="benefits">
			<h3><span>Innovation</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>We decide to present the information as a Treemap, as this is a natural way to present and compare proportions. We enriched the treemap with ranking deduction, clicking effects and treemap navigation to zoom in the details of the properties of a person or economic group.</span></p>
		</div>

		<div id="benefits">
			<h3><span>Future Work</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span>The presented visualisation tools, can be improved by adding the missing information that we did not found,  and by normalizing the data to one only time window.</span></p>
