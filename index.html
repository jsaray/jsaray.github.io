			<h3><span><a href="#intro">Introduction and Motivation</a></span></h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="p1"><span>Even with the raise of Internet and Social Media, conventional mass media still influences people over TV, press and Radio, and they are yet one of the hidden rulers of a nation. </span>
		<br>
			<br>
			<span>
			Their influence is achieved on different ways : first of all and the most important, they impose a reality over people, as they are the ones who choose which information must be broadcasted, and which information must be banned, second, they have the power to choose words and sentences to their convenience to tell a story according to their interests and provoke emotions on the spectator. 

			On the other hand, mass media are not kindness  and selfless actors looking always for the general interest. Sometimes they follow the stakeholders, owners and the ruling political party interests, even spreading rumors if necessary. They usually go against their initial mission : telling what is really happening. 
			</span>
			<br>
			<br>
			<span>
			By all these reasons, we are motivated to present you a ranking of who are the owners of Mass media in France. So that you can be informed of who is behind the news and information you receive in your daily live, and this can become part of your internal thoughts at any time
			you watch the news.

				We have used different techniques in order to produce the final results shown here. 
				First of all, we have centralized different excel DataSets in one Excel sheet extracting and filtering only the useful information. Then we used Java programming language to transform this excel sheet in a Json Object to be parsed by D3 javascript framework, we have choosen this JavaScript framework thanks to its versatility and esthetically appealing results.
